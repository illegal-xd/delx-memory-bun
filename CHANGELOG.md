## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-12

### Added / Changed (upstream 0.3.0 integration, bun fork)

- **Lite stdio transport (default):** newline JSON-RPC tools path that does **not** load `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` at boot (`--lite` / `DELX_MEMORY_TRANSPORT=lite`). Lowest RSS for always-on agents.
- **SDK path:** `--sdk` / `DELX_MEMORY_TRANSPORT=sdk` for full prompts + resources (previous default surface).
- **Tool catalog behind a facade** (`tool-registry.ts` + `catalog.ts`): handlers captured once via `capturingServer()`, shared by lite + SDK — core/adapter separation at the transport boundary.
- **HTTP transport extracted** to `http-server.ts`, still native `node:http` (no Express/CORS) — bun fork RSS optimization preserved.
- Smoke: full suite on `--sdk`; new `smoke:lite` (runs under `bun`, exercising the `bun:sqlite` backend).
- `doctor` reports `transport_default` / `transports` / `lean_mode`.
- **HTTP boot RSS fix**: deferred `sdk-stdio` load to first request (lazy server factory) — boot RSS 71MB → 24MB (0.3.0 initial integration paid the full MCP SDK dependency tree at startup; request steady-state also improved 78 → 76MB).
- **sdk-stdio internal lazy loading**: `createSdkServer()` is now async and imports McpServer/tools/prompts/resources inside the factory — merely loading `sdk-stdio.js` no longer pulls the SDK dependency tree.
- **PM2 container RSS**: rebuilt with `pmx=false` (disables `@pm2/io` injection in the pm2 container process) — container 35MB → 19MB. Server child is unaffected (already a bare bun process).
- Note: reusing one `McpServer` across HTTP requests is not possible — the MCP SDK `Protocol.connect()` throws if already connected (per-request server is the SDK's stateless-HTTP contract). Per-request server creation measured at ~8-15ms, acceptable; further HTTP memory work would require a custom streamable-HTTP transport (see `experience:no-sdk-jsonrpc-memory-gain`).

## 0.2.5 - 2026-07-30

### Added / Fixed

- MCP prompts: setup_status, search_then_act, triage_errors.

## 0.2.4 - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Agent-readiness surface: `memory_agent_manifest`, `memory_connection_status`, `memory_data_inventory`, `memory_capabilities` + MCP resources.
- Optional `privacy_mode` on read tools (`summary` omits full values / search snippets).

# Changelog

All notable changes to `delx-memory` follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and adhere to [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-27

### Security
- Pin transitive `hono` resolution to `4.12.27` via npm overrides, resolving production audit advisories while keeping the public MCP API unchanged.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Tool annotations on all 8 tools** (`readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint` / `openWorldHint`) so MCP agents (Claude, Goose, Cursor) can reason about each tool's safety before calling. `memory_get` / `memory_list` / `memory_search` / `memory_stats` are read-only + idempotent; `memory_forget` / `memory_forget_by_tag` are destructive; `memory_set` is a non-destructive idempotent upsert; `memory_export` is read-only (still gated by `explicit_user_intent`). Every tool is `openWorldHint: false` — the whole server is local SQLite and never touches the network. No behavior, schema, or gating change.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- `examples/fts5-search.md` quickstart plus a runnable
  `examples/fts5-search-quickstart.mjs` that boots the real server against a
  throwaway DB and demonstrates the v0.2 FTS5 engine: bm25-ranked multi-word
  search, prefix matching, diacritic folding, and tag indexing. The Markdown is
  the script's verbatim captured output. README links to it.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- FTS5 full-text search backing `memory_search`: an external-content virtual
  table mirrors `key`/`value`/`tags`, kept in sync via insert/update/delete
  triggers. Queries use bm25 relevance ranking (key-weighted), Porter stemming,
  diacritic folding, and per-token prefix matching, so multi-word, partial and
  accent-insensitive queries now rank by relevance instead of last-write order.
- `memory_search` responses now include an `engine` field (`"fts5"` or
  `"like"`) so callers can see which path served the query.

### Changed
- `memory_search` automatically falls back to the previous LIKE substring scan
  when the SQLite build lacks the FTS5 module, preserving behavior everywhere.
- Existing 0.1.x databases are backfilled into the FTS index on first open
  after upgrade — no manual migration needed.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-23

Initial release.

### Added
- 8 MCP tools: `memory_get`, `memory_list`, `memory_search`, `memory_stats`, `memory_set`, `memory_forget`, `memory_forget_by_tag`, `memory_export`.
- SQLite store at `~/.delx-memory/db.sqlite` (override via `DELX_MEMORY_PATH`).
- Directory `0700` + file `0600` permissions (POSIX best-effort).
- Credential-shape refusal — keys + nested values walked for OAuth/Bearer/Stripe/Slack/GitHub/OpenAI/AWS/Authorization patterns.
- `explicit_user_intent: true` gate on every mutating tool.
- TTL with lazy expiry sweep on every read.
- Tags + prefix filters on `memory_list`.
- LIKE-based keyword search across keys and values (FTS planned for a later release).
- Export to JSON / JSONL / Markdown with optional `since` / `until` window on `updated_at`.
- CLI: `setup`, `doctor`, `version`, `help` plus `--http` / `--json` flags.
- HTTP transport binding `127.0.0.1:3030` by default with strict CORS.

### Security
- No telemetry, no phone-home.
- All test scripts use ephemeral tmpdirs — no test ever touches the user's real DB.
